# Brief note of No.12

Questions:

1. The observations of GW170817 and GRB 170817A?
2. The connection?
3. The implication?
4. Why this GRB is less energetic than typical?
5. The joint detection rate?

Methods:

1. GW170817
    - sky-location and signal offset time: EM follow-up observations (targeted searches???)
    - Hubble flow velocity + Hubble canstants -> verification of GW distance 
    - GW data and known distance could constrain the inclination angle which could further constrain the jet viewing angle with two reasonable assumptions.
    - see the reference articles PhRvL, 119, 161101

2. GRB 170817
    - compareing the properies of gamma-ray data to the known distribution of short and long GRBs, Goldstein confirmed GRB 170817A as a short GRB.

3. Association confirmation
    - temporal agreement for being independent events: $P_{temporal} = 2\Delta t_{SGRB-GW} R_{GBM-SGRB}5.0 \times 10^{-6}$.
    - spatial agreement for being independent events: ??? result: 0.01
    - together: $5.0 \times 10^{-7}$

4. Implications
    - the diviation of the speed of gravity from the speed of light: $\Delta v/v_{EM} \approx v_{EM} \Delta t/D$
      - with different $\Delta t$ resulting in upper and lower limits.

    - the limits on Lorentz invariance violation
      - the effective field theory

    - the confirmation on the Equivalence princeple
      - shapiro delay

    - the size and lorentz factor of the emitting region from explaining the time delay
      - the lag from merger time to the collision between two shells (internal origin)
      - external origin
      - photospheric: thermal radiation (flawed)

    -  

Conlutions:

- The joint event set a **stringent limits on fundamental physics** and **probed the central engine of SGRBs** in ways that have not been possible with EM data alone.

- Unambiguous association of GW170817 and GRB 170817A

- Explanations for the observed dimness of GRB170817A is proposed.

- Joint detection could be more common than previously predicted.
