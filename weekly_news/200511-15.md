Multi-waveband synchrotron linear polarization of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows is studied <u>under the assumption of anisotropic turbulent magnetic field with coherence length on plasma skin depth scales in the downstream of forward shocks</u>.  
We find that for typical GRBs, in comparison to the optical polarization, the radio polarization degree shows a similar temporal evolution but a smaller peak value by a factor of∼5. This results from differences of <u>observed intensity image shapes between the radio and optical bands</u>.
We also show that the polarization degree spectrum has a gradual variation from low to high polarization regime <u>above the intensity spectral peak frequency</u>, and that the difference of polarization angles in the two regimes is zero or 90 degrees. Thus, simultaneous multi-waveband polarimetric observations of GRB afterglows would be a new firm test of the plasma-scale magnetic field model.
We also discuss theoretical implications from the recent detection of radio linear polarization in GRB 171205A with ALMA, other models of magnetic field configuration, and Faraday depolarization effects by thermal electrons.

### Titanium and Iron in the Cassiopeia A Supernova Remnant

`https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03777`

Authors: Gregory S. Vance, Patrick A. Young, Christopher L. Fryer et al.

Mixing above the proto-neutron star is believed to play an important role in the supernova engine, and this mixing results in a supernova explosion with asymmetries. Elements produced in the innermost ejecta, e.g., 56Ni and 44Ti, provide a clean probe of this engine. **The production of 44Ti is particularly sensitive to the exact production pathway and, by understanding the available pathways, we can use 44Ti to probe the supernova engine.** Using <u>thermodynamic trajectories from a three-dimensional supernova explosion model</u>, we review the production of these elements and the structures expected to form under the "convective-engine" paradigm behind supernovae. We compare our results to recent X-ray and γ-ray observations of the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant.

- 原生中子星(proto-neutron star)的混合(mixing，与流体力学不稳定性有关)被认为在超新星引擎中发挥重要作用，且这种混合会导致超新星爆发的不对称性。
- 在最内部的喷发物中产生的Ni56和Ti44可以作为这种引擎机制的探针，尤其是Ti44的产生（产量？）对(爆发的)具体生产过程非常敏感。如果能弄清它的产生过程，就可利用Ti44作为超新星引擎的探针。

Enhancing Gravitational-Wave Science with Machine Learning
`https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03745`

Authors: Elena Cuoco, Jade Powell, Marco Cavaglià et al.

Machine learning has emerged as a popular and powerful approach for solving problems in astrophysics. We review applications of machine learning techniques for the analysis of ground-based gravitational-wave detector data. Examples include techniques for improving the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave searches, methods for fast measurements of the astrophysical parameters of gravitational-wave sources, and algorithms for reduction and characterization of non-astrophysical detector noise. These applications demonstrate how machine learning techniques may be harnessed to enhance the science that is possible with current and future gravitational-wave detectors.

- 我们回顾了机器学习在分析地基引力波探测器的数据中的应用
- 例子包括：提高LIGO/Virgo探测灵敏度的技术，快速测量引力波源的天体物理参数，以及对非天体物理的探测噪音的测定(characterization)及消除的算法等。也可以帮助搜寻引力波信号的电磁对应体。
- 这些例子展示了如何利用机器学习来帮助和促进涉及到现有及将来的引力波探测器相关的科学研究。

Deep-Learning Continuous Gravitational Waves: Multiple detectors and realistic noise
`https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04140`

Authors: Christoph Dreissigacker, Reinhard Prix

The sensitivity of wide-parameter-space searches for continuous gravitational waves is limited by computational cost. Recently it was shown that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can perform all-sky searches directly on (single-detector) strain data, potentially providing a low-computing-cost search method that could lead to a better overall sensitivity.

Here we expand on this study in two respects: (i) using (simulated) strain data from two detectors simultaneously, and (ii) training for directed (i.e.\ single sky-position) searches in addition to all-sky searches. For a data timespan of T=105s, the all-sky two-detector DNN is about 7% less sensitive (in amplitude h0) at low frequency (f=20Hz), and about 51% less sensitive at high frequency (f=1000Hz) compared to fully-coherent matched-filtering (using WEAVE). In the directed case the sensitivity gap compared to matched-filtering ranges from about 7−14% at f=20Hz to about 37−49% at f=1500Hz. Furthermore we assess the DNN's ability to generalize in signal frequency, spindown and sky-position, and we test its robustness to realistic data conditions, namely gaps in the data and using real LIGO detector noise. We find that the DNN performance is not adversely affected by gaps in the test data or by using a relatively undisturbed band of LIGO detector data instead of Gaussian noise. However, when using a more disturbed LIGO band for the tests, the DNN's detection performance is substantially degraded due to the increase in false alarms, as expected.

- 对连续引力波的广参数空间(wide-parameter-space)搜寻的灵敏度被计算成本限制。
- 最近有研究表明深度神经网络(Deep Neural Networks)可以直接依靠strain data来做全天搜寻，提供了一个潜在的低计算成本和更好的整体灵敏度的搜寻方法。

### Implications of a "Fast Radio Burst" from a Galactic Magnetar

`https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05283`

Authors: Ben Margalit, Paz Beniamini, Navin Sridhar, Brian D. Metzger

A luminous radio burst was recently detected in temporal coincidence with a hard X-ray flare from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 with a time and frequency structure consistent with cosmological fast radio bursts (FRB) and a fluence within a factor of ≲30 of the least energetic extragalactic FRB previously detected.

Although active magnetars are commonly invoked FRB sources, several distinct mechanisms have been proposed for generating the radio emission which make different predictions for the accompanying higher frequency radiation.

We show that <u>the properties of the coincident radio and X-ray flares from SGR 1935+2154</u>, including their approximate simultaneity and relative fluence $E_{radio}/E_{X} \sim 10^{-5}$, as well as the duration and spectrum of the X-ray emission, are consistent with extant predictions for the synchrotron maser shock model.

Rather than arising from the inner magnetosphere, the X-rays are generated by (incoherent) synchrotron radiation from thermal electrons heated at the same shocks which produce the coherent maser emission.

Although the rate of SGR 1935+2154-like bursts in the local universe is not sufficient to contribute appreciably to the extragalactic FRB rate, the inclusion of an additional population of more active magnetars with stronger magnetic fields than the Galactic population can explain both the FRB rate as well as the repeating fraction, however only if the population of active magnetars are born at a rate that is at least two-orders of magnitude lower than that of SGR 1935+2154-like magnetars.

This may imply that the more active magnetar sources are not younger magnetars formed in a similar way to the Milky Way population (e.g. via ordinary supernovae), but instead through more exotic channels such as superluminous supernovae, accretion-induced collapse or neutron star mergers.

- 最近探测到了一次明亮的射电爆，它在时间上与河内磁星SGR 1935+2154发出的硬X射线耀发相吻合。这次射电暴的时间和频率结构（光变和光谱？）均与宇宙学起源的FRB相一致，其流量则在之前探测到的河外FRB最小能量1/30以上。

![fig](./0512_1_fig1.png)

- 尽管通常认为活跃磁星是FRB的起源，也有一些不同的产生射电辐射的机制，这些机制对伴随的高频辐射会作出不同预测。
- 我们指出，来自SGR 1935+2154的X射线耀发和探测到的射电爆发的性质与现有的同步辐射微波激射激波模型的预测一致。这些性质包括他们的近似同时性，相对流量$E_{radio}/E_{X} \sim 10^{-5}$，以及X射线辐射光谱的持续时间和光谱。
- （同步辐射微波激射激波模型中）X射线并非产生自内部磁层，而是由不连贯的热电子同步辐射产生的，且加热这些热电子的激波同时也产生连续的微波激射。
- 尽管邻近宇宙的类SGR 1935+2154事件的发生率不足以对河外FRB的发生率作出显著贡献，但如果把带有更强磁场的活跃磁星作为对河内事件的补充也算进来，就可以解释FRB的发生率以及其中的复现部分。不过这么做的前提是活跃磁星的产生率至少要比类SGR 1935+2154磁星的产生率低两个量级。
- 这可能表示更多活跃磁星的形成方式与银河系中的年轻磁星的形成方式（如普通超新星）有所不同，它们可能是通过更特殊的形成方式产生的，如超亮超新星，吸积导致的塌缩，或中子星的合并。

### Fast Radio Bursts from reconnection events in magnetar magnetospheres

`https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05093`

Authors: Maxim Lyutikov (Purdue University), Sergey Popov (Sternberg Astronomical Institute, Higher School of Economics)

Lyutikov (2002) predicted "radio emission from soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) during their bursting activity". Detection of a Mega-Jansky radio burst in temporal coincidence with high energy bursts from a Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 confirms that prediction. Similarity of this radio event with Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) suggests that FRBs are produced within magnetar magnetospheres.

We demonstrate that SGR 1935+2154 satisfies the <u>previously derived constraints on the physical parameters at the FRBs' loci.</u> Coherent radio emission is generated in the inner parts of the magnetosphere at $r<100R_{NS}$. The radio emission is produced by the yet unidentified plasma emission process, occurring during the initial stages of reconnection events.

- Lyutikov在2002年预测了SGR在爆发的活跃时期也会发出射电辐射。最近发生的SGR 1935+2154的爆发以及时间上吻合的射电爆证实了这样的预测。这次射电事件与FRB的相似性反映了FRB是在磁星的磁层中产生的。

- 我们证实了SGR 1935+2154满足先前导出的关于FRB发生地（loci）的物理参数的限制。连续的射电辐射是$r<100R_{NS}$的磁层内部产生的。产生机制为目前还未确定的等离子体辐射过程，它发生在重联事件的起始阶段。

### GW190412 as a Third-Generation Black Hole Merger from a Super Star Cluster

`GW190412 as a Third-Generation Black Hole Merger from a Super Star Cluster`

Authors: Carl L. Rodriguez, Kyle Kremer, Michael Y. Grudić et al.

We explore the possibility that GW190412, a binary black hole merger with a non-equal-mass ratio and significantly spinning primary, was formed through repeated black hole mergers in a dense super star cluster. Using a combination of semi-analytic prescriptions for the remnant spin and recoil kick of black hole mergers, we show that the mass ratio and spin of GW190412 are consistent with a binary black hole whose primary component has undergone two successive mergers from a population of ∼10M⊙ black holes in a high-metallicity environment.

We then explore the production of GW190412-like analogs in the CMC Cluster Catalog, a grid of 148 N-body star cluster models, as well as a new model, behemoth, with nearly 107 particles and initial conditions taken from a cosmological MHD simulation of galaxy formation.
We show that the production of binaries with GW190412-like masses and spins is dominated by massive super star clusters with high metallicities and large central escape speeds. While many are observed in the local universe, our results suggest that a careful treatment of these massive clusters, many of which may have been disrupted before the present day, is necessary to characterize the production of unique gravitational-wave events produced through dynamics.

- 我们探索了GW190412所起源的双黑洞并合事件实际上已经经历了重复的黑洞并合过程的可能性，且其发生在稠密的超级星团中(dense super star cluster)。
- 通过结合对残骸自旋的半解析描述(prescription)以及对黑洞并合的反冲效应(recoil kick)，我们指出GW190412中较重质量的黑洞已经经历过两次成功的并合，且它们发生在高金属丰度的环境，过程中有多个10倍M⊙的黑洞参与。

![fig](./0512_3_fig1.png)

- 我们的工作（分析一些星团模型）指出，要产生质量和自旋类似GW190412这样的双星系统，具有高金属丰度和大的中心逃逸速度的大质量超级星团(massive super star cluster)的存在具有至关重要。
- 由于已经在邻近宇宙中观测到较多这样的星团了，我们的结果表明，对这些星团（其中的许多可能已经被打散(disrupted)了）进行详细的研究对于描述动力学成因(produced through dynamics)的特殊引力波事件是必要的。

Astrophysical implications of GW190412 as a remnant of a previous black-hole merger
`https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04243`

Authors: Davide Gerosa, Salvatore Vitale, Emanuele Berti

Two of the dominant channels to produce merging stellar-mass black-hole binaries are believed to be the <u>isolated evolution of binary stars in the field</u> and dynamical formation in star clusters. The first black-hole binary event from the third LIGO/Virgo observing run (GW190412) is unusual in that it has unequal masses, nonzero effective spin, and nonzero primary spin at 90% confidence interval. We show that this event should be exceedingly rare in the context of both the field and cluster formation scenarios.

Interpreting GW190412 as a remnant of a previous black-hole merger provides a promising route to explain its features. If GW190412 indeed formed <u>hierarchically</u>, we show that the region of the parameter space which is best motivated from an astrophysical standpoint (low natal spins and light clusters) cannot accommodate the observation.

We analyze public GW190412 LIGO/Virgo data with a Bayesian prior where the more massive black hole resulted from a previous merger, and find that this scenario is equally supported by the data. If the heavier component of GW190412 is indeed a merger remnant, then its spin magnitude is $\chi_1 = 0.56^{+0.19}_{-0.21}$, higher than the value previously reported by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration.

- 形成双黑洞系统并合的主要途径有两种：双星在场（相互的引力场？）中的独立演化，以及星团中的动力学结果。
- GW190412的双黑洞系统具有非对等的质量，非零的有效自(effective spin)及初始自旋(primary spin)，这些都让此次事件不同寻常，在两种形成方式中都很罕见。
- 将GW190412看作黑洞并合的残骸的话有希望对观测到的特征作出解释。如果GW190412的形成真的具有层级性，则从天体物理角度(low natal spins and light clusters)出发确定的最好的参数空间不符合观测。（下图中GW190412倾向于$\chi_{M} > 0.3, v_{esc} > 150 km/s$,即右上角，而理论上可能更倾向与左下区域）

![fig](./0512_4_fig1.png)

- 观测数据也支持把更重的黑洞看作是由先前的并合产生的。如果真是这样，那么更重的那个黑洞的自旋程度是$\chi_1 = 0.56^{+0.19}_{-0.21}$，高于之前LIGO/Virgo所报道的。

Detections of simultaneous brightening of gamma-ray and optical emissions of a high-redshift blazar GB 1508+5714
`https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04844`

Authors: Neng-Hui Liao, Shang Li, Yi-Zhong Fan

GB 1508+5714 is a high-redshift blazar (z = 4.3) and a spectrally soft gamma-ray source has been found in its direction. By analyzing 11.4-yr Fermi-LAT data, significant long-term variability of the gamma-ray source is confirmed. More importantly, a gamma-ray emission flare appeared in an epoch of several tens of days in year 2018, when the flux is about four times of the value from the global fit. Meanwhile, optical flares displayed in both i- and r-bands from the Zwicky Transient Facility light curves. Detections of the simultaneous gamma-ray and optical brightening provide a decisive proof to pin down the association between the gamma-ray source and GB 1508+5714, which makes it the first identified gamma-ray blazar beyond redshift 4. Future multiwavelength campaigns are needed to further investigate its jet properties, and, upcoming wide-deep-fast optical telescopes together with the gamma-ray sky surveyors will shed lights on the role that the AGN jets play in the early cosmic time.

- GB 1508+5714是一个高红移(z=4.3)的耀变体，且在其方向上发现了一个具有较软光谱的伽玛射线源。
- 通过分析Fermi-LAT11.4年的数据，我们证实了该伽玛源显著的长期变化。
