## Abstract

On 2017 August 17, the gravitational-wave event GW170817 was observed by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, and the gamma-ray burst(GRB)GRB 170817A was observed independently by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, and <font color=purple>the Anti-Coincidence Shield for the Spectrometer</font> for the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory.

The probability of the near-simultaneous temporal and spatial observation of GRB 170817A and GW170817 occurring by chance is 5.0 x 10e-8. We therefore confirm binary neutron star mergers as a progenitor of short GRBs. The association of GW170817 and GRB 170817A provides new insight into fundamental physics and the origin of short GRBs.

We use the observed time delay of (+1.74 ± 0.05)s between GRB 170817A and GW170817 to:(i) constrain the difference between the speed of gravity and the speed of light to be between -3 x 10e-15 and +7 x 10e-16 times the speed of light,(ii) place new bounds on the violation of Lorentz invariance,(iii) present a new test of the equivalence principle by constraining the Shapiro delay between gravitational and electromagnetic radiation. We also use the time delay to constrain the size and bulk Lorentz factor of the region emitting the gamma-rays.

GRB 170817A is the closest short GRB with a known distance, but is between 2 and 6 orders of magnitude less energetic than other bursts with measured redshift. A new generation of gamma-ray detectors,and subthreshold searches in existing detectors, will be essential to detect similar short bursts at greater distances.

Finally, we predict a joint detection rate for the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors of 0.1–1.4 per year during the 2018–2019 observing run and 0.3–1.7 per year at design sensitivity.

## 1. Introduction and Background

[Back](#menu)

GW170817 and GRB 170817A mark the discovery of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger detected both as a gravitational wave (GW; LIGO Scientiﬁc Collaboration & Virgo Collaboration 2017a) and a short-duration gamma-ray burst (SGRB; Goldstein et al. 2017; Savchenko et al. 2017b). Detecting GW radiation from the coalescence of BNS and neutron star (NS)– black hole (BH) binary systems has been a major goal (Abbott et al. 2017a) of the LIGO (Aasi et al. 2015) and Virgo (Acernese et al. 2015) experiments. This was at least partly motivated by their promise of being the most likely sources of simultaneously detectable GW and electromagnetic (EM) radiation from the same source. This is important as joint detections enable a wealth of science unavailable from either messenger alone (Abbott et al. 2017f). <font color=red>BNS mergers are predicted to yield signatures across the EM spectrum, including SGRBs</font>, which produce prompt emission in gamma-rays and longer-lived afterglows.
>1.BNS and NS-BH are major goals of LIGO/VIRGO for being the most likely sources of simultaneously detectable GW and EM radiation from the same srouce.<br />2.BNS could yield signatures across the EM spectrum, including SGRBs.

A major astrophysical implication of a joint detection of an SGRB and of GWs from a BNS merger is the conﬁrmation that these binaries are indeed the progenitors of at least some SGRBs. GRBs are classiﬁed as short or long depending on the duration of their prompt gamma-ray emission. This cut is based on spectral differences in gamma-rays and the bimodality of the observed distribution of these durations. This empirical division was accompanied by hypotheses that the two classes have different progenitors. Long GRBs have been ﬁrmly connected to the collapse of massive stars through the detection of associated Type Ibc core-collapse supernovae. Prior to the results reported here, support for the connection between SGRBs and mergers of BNSs (or NS–BH binaries) came only from indirect observational evidence(Nakar 2007; Berger et al.2013; Tanvir et al.2013; Berger 2014), population synthesis studies (Bloom et al. 1999; Fryer et al. 1999; Belczynski et al.2006), and numerical simulations (e.g., Aloy et al. 2005; Rezzolla et al. 2011; Kiuchi et al. 2015; Baiotti & Rezzolla 2017; Kawamura et al. 2016; Ruiz et al. 2016). The unambiguous joint detection of GW and EM radiation from the same event conﬁrms that BNS mergers are progenitors of (at least some) SGRBs.
>Hitherto, the connection between SGRBs and BNS(or NS-BH) mergers was only supported indirectly by observational evidence and numerical simulations. This joint detection confirmed the connection.

In Section 2 we describe the independent observations of GW170817 by the LIGO–Virgo and of GRB 170817A by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and by the SPectrometer on board INTEGRAL Anti-Coincidence Shield (SPIACS). In Section 3 we establish the ﬁrm association between GW170817 and GRB 170817A. In Section 4 we explore the constraints on fundamental physics that can be obtained from the time separation between the GW and EM signals. In Section 5 we explore the implications of the joint detection of GW170817 and GRB 170817A on the SGRB engine and the NS equation of state (EOS). In Section 6 we explore the implications of the comparative dimness of GRB 170817A relative to the known SGRB population and revise the expectation rates for joint BNS–SGRB detections in the light of this discovery.

## 2. Observational Results

The observations of GW170817 and of GRB 170817A are described in detail in Abbott et al. (2017e), Goldstein et al. (2017), and Savchenko et al. (2017b). Here we summarize the observations relevant to the results presented in this Letter and report the results of two fully coherent searches for GWs from the sky location of GRB 170817A. For convenience, all measurements of time have been converted to their <font color=purple>geocentric equivalent.</font>
>In here we just summarize the observations relevant to our results.<br />All the time measurments here have been converted to geocentric equivalent, in order to adapt the GW signal arrival time.

### 2.1 LIGO–Virgo Observation of GW17081

<font color=red>GW170817 is a GW signal from the inspiral of two low-mass compact objects and is the ﬁrst GW observation consistent with a BNS coalescence.</font> GW170817 was ﬁrst observed by a <font color=purple>low-latency</font> search on 2017 August 17 at 12:41:04 UTC as a single-detector trigger in the LIGO-Hanford detector. The temporal proximity of GRB 170817A was immediately identiﬁed by automatic comparison of the Fermi-GBM Gamma-ray Coordinates Network notice to the GW trigger. Rapid ofﬂine re-analysis of data from the LIGO/Virgo network conﬁrmed the presence of a signiﬁcant coincident signal in the LIGO GW detectors with a combined signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 32.4. <font color=red>The combination of observations from the LIGO and Virgo detectors allowed a precise sky position localization to an area of 28 deg^2 at 90% probability</font> shown in green in Figure 1. A time-frequency representation of the LIGO data containing GW170817 is shown in the bottom panel of Figure 2. The GPS time of the merger of GW170817 is $T_0^{GW} = 1187008882.430_{-0.002}^{+0.002}s$. <font color=red>At the observed signal strength,the false alarm rate of the all-sky search for compact-object mergers is **less than 1 in 80,000 years**.</font> The ofﬂine searches target binaries with (detector frame) total mass 2–500 $M_{sun}$. Signals are required to be coincident in time and mass in the LIGO detectors, but Virgo data are not used in the signiﬁcance estimates of the all-sky ofﬂine search.

We present the results of two <font color=purple>ofﬂine targeted searches</font> that coherently combine the data from the LIGO and Virgo detectors, and <font color=red>restrict the signal offset time and sky-location using information from the EM observation of GRB 170817A</font>. The onset of gamma-ray emission from a BNS merger progenitor is predicted to be within a few seconds after the merger, given that <font color=blue>the central engine is expected to form within a few seconds and that the jet propagation delays are at most of the order of the SGRB duration</font>. <font color=blue>The gravitational and EM waves are expected to travel at the same speed. </font>
>What are the targeted searches used for???<br />We restict the signal offset time and sky-location using information from the EM observation of GRB 170817A.

The ﬁrst targeted search assumes that the source is a BNS or NS–BH binary merger and is located at the sky-position observed for the optical counterpart to GW170817 and GRB 170817A and that there is a [-1, +5] s time delay in the arrival of gamma-rays (determined by the GBM trigger time) compared to the binary merger time. At the detection statistic value assigned to GW170817, this search has a <font color=purple>p-value</font> of < 9.4 x 10e-6(>4.2$\sigma$), with this signiﬁcance estimate limited by computational resources used to estimate the noise background. The second coherent search does not assume any particular GW morphology or GRB model and uses the GBM localization of GRB 170817A to constrain the sky location of the source. This search allows for a [-60, +600] s coincidence between the gamma-rays and the GWs in order to include potentially larger delays in collapsar models of long GRBs. At the detection-statistic value observed for GW170817, this search has a p-value of 1.3 x 10e-5(4.2$\sigma$).
>Informations and results of these two targeted searches:<br />1.the p-value of the first search is of < 9.4 x 10e-6(>4.2$\sigma$), assuming a time delay of [-1, +5] s and a BNS or NS-BH source.<br />2.the p-value of the second search is of < 1.3 x 10e-5(4.2$\sigma$), assuming no particular source type and allowing a [-60, +600] s time delay.

The 90% credible intervals for the component masses (in the $m_1 \ge m_2$ convention) are $m_1 \in (1.36, 2.26) M_{sun}$ and $m_2 \in (0.86, 1.36) M_{sun}$ , with total mass $2.82_{-0.09}^{+0.47} M_{sun}$, when considering <font color=purple>dimensionless spins</font> with magnitudes up to 0.89 (high-spin prior, hereafter). When the dimensionless spin prior is restricted to $\le$0.05  (low-spin prior, hereafter), the measured component masses are $m_1 \in (1.36, 1.60) M_{sun}$ and $m_2 \in (1.17, 1.36) M_{sun}$, and the total mass is $2.74_{-0.01}^{+0.04} M_{sun}$. This result is consistent with the masses of all known BNS systems. From the GW signal, the best measured combination of the masses is the chirp mass $M = (m_1m_2)^{3/5}/(m_1+m_2)^{1/5}$, which in the detector frame is found to be $1.977_{-0.0003}^{+0.0008} M_{sun}$.

The detection of GW170817 triggered a campaign of EM follow-up observations which led to the identiﬁcation of NGC 4993 as the host galaxy of GW170817/GRB 170817A. We evaluate the distance to the host galaxy from the ratio of the <font color=purple>Hubble ﬂow velocity of the host</font> $3017 \pm 166 km s^{-1}$ and two current measurements of the Hubble constant. These two distance measures are within a combined range of <font color=red>$42.9 \pm 3.2$ Mpc</font>, which is consistent with the distance of $40_{-14}^{+8}$ Mpc determined with GW data alone and <font color=red>makes GW170817 the closest GW event ever observed.</font>
> From the ratio of the Hubble flow velocity of the host galaxy (identified by the follow-up observations) and the current measurements of the Hubble constant, the distance to the host galaxy is evaluated to be $42.9 \pm 3.2$ Mpc, consistent with the $40_{-14}^{+8}$ Mpc determined with GW data alone.

The GW data constrain the <font color=blue>inclination angle $\Theta_{JN}$ between the total angular momentum of the system and the line of sight to be anti-aligned</font>, with cos$\Theta_{JN} \le -0.54$. As the binary system component masses are comparable, the NS spins have little impact on the total angular momentum which is aligned with the orbital angular momentum within a few degrees. <font color=red>For discussions in this Letter we will assume that the orbital and total angular momenta are aligned.</font> The SGRB jet is expected to be perpendicular to the accretion disk of the central engine if powered by neutrino annihilation or aligned with the magnetic pole of the rotating central object, <font color=red>hence we assume the SGRB jet is aligned with the system rotation axis.</font> This yields a jet viewing angle $\zeta = min(\Theta_{JN}, 180\degree - \Theta_{JN}) \le 56\degree$. <font color=blue>As the distance measurement is correlated with $\Theta_{JN}$</font> , <font color=red>the known distance to NGC 4993 further constrains the viewing angle to $\zeta \le 36\degree$ or $\zeta \le 28\degree$ depending on the assumed value of the Hubble constant</font>, with smaller values of the Hubble constant giving smaller misalignment angles.

### 2.2 Fermi-GBM Observation of GRB 170817A

GRB 170817A was autonomously detected in-orbit by the GBM ﬂight software in a process known as “triggering.” Goldstein et al. (2017) showed the signal exceeds 5σ in three (of twelve) GBM NaI detectors. <font color=red>The GBM detection showed two apparently distinct components. The triggering pulse, that lasts about half a second and falls within the usual observer distributions for GBM SGRBs, is shorter and spectrally harder than the subsequent softer, weaker emission that lasts a few seconds</font>. Summed GBM lightcurves from the relevant detectors in two energy ranges, selected to show the two distinct components, are shown in the top two panels in Figure 2. The GBM time-tagged event data is binned to match the SPI-ACS temporal resolution (100 ms) and phase (matching bin edges) to allow for an easier comparison between the gamma-ray instruments.

Goldstein et al. quantify the likelihood of GRB 170817A being an SGRB based only on gamma-ray data. This is done by comparing the measured gamma-ray properties of GRB 170817A to the known distributions of short and long GRBs. <font color=red>Both the duration distribution alone and the duration and spectral hardness distributions together show that GRB 170817A is three times more likely to be an SGRB than a long GRB.</font> These analyses are performed in a standard manner, resulting in a longer duration measure than apparent from the hard spike alone because the softer, weaker tail contributes to the calculated duration.
>Goldstein confirmed the likelihood of GRB 170817A as being an SGRBs based on gamma-ray data by considering the known distributions of short and long GRBs.

The final GBM localization of GRB 170817A (including
systematic error) calculated by the GBM targeted search
pipeline is shown in Figure 1. This pipeline performs a
coherent search over all GBM detectors (NaI and BGO) and <font color=blue>was originally developed to find gamma-ray signals below the onboard triggering threshold around GW triggers</font>. The 50% and 90% credible regions cover ∼350 deg^2 and ∼1100 deg^2, respectively.
>The final GBM localization of GRB 170817A: ∼350 deg^2 for 50% credible regions and ~1100 deg^2 for 90% credible regions.

Fitting the main pulse in the GBM data with a parameterized function commonly used for GRB pulses indicates a gamma-ray emission onset of 0.310±0.048 s before $T_0^{GBM}$ , where $T_0^{GBM}$ is defined as the time of the GBM trigger . Based on the position of the optical transient, the signal arrives at Fermi 3.176 ms before it arrives at geocenter. <font color=purple>With this correction we find that the start of the gamma-ray emission relative to the $T_0^{GW}$ is ( +1.74 $\pm$ 0.05 ) s</font> . In this Letter all derived gamma-ray results use 68% confidence levels.
>The start of the gamma-ray emission relative to the $T_0^{GW}$ is (+1.74 $\pm$ 0.05) s

The spectral analysis using the standard GBM catalog criteria uses data from the 256 ms time interval between $T_0^{GBM}$ - 0.192 s and $T_0^{GBM}$ + 0.064 s . <font color=red>A fit to the “Comptonized” function, a power law with a high-energy exponential cutoff, is preferred over both a simple power-law fit or models with more parameters.</font> The fit produces values of $E_{peak} = (215 ± 54)$ keV, and a poorly constrained power-law index $\alpha$ = 0.14 $\pm$ 0.59 . The average flux for this interval in the 10–1000 keV range is (5.5 $\pm$ 1.2) x 10$^{-7}$ erg / s cm$^2$ with a corresponding fluence of (1.4 $\pm$ 0.3) x 10$^{-7}$ erg / cm$^2$ . The shorter peak interval selection from $T_0^{GBM}$ - 0.128 s to $T_0^{GBM}$ - 0.064 s fit prefers the Comptonized function, yielding consistent parameters $E_{peak} = (229 ± 78)$ keV, $\alpha$ = 0.85 $\pm$ 1.38 , and peak energy flux in the 10–1000 keV of (7.3 $\pm$ 2.5) x 10$^{-7}$ erg / s cm$^2$ . <font color=red>These standard fits are used to compare GRB 170817A to the rest of the SGRBs detected by GBM and to place GRB 170817A in context with the population of SGRBs with known redshift.</font>
> -0.192 s ~ +0.064 s - Comptonization - $E_{peak} = (215 ± 54)$ keV, $\alpha$ = 0.14 $\pm$ 0.59, average flux:(5.5 $\pm$ 1.2) x 10$^{-7}$, fluence: (1.4 $\pm$ 0.3) x 10$^{-7}$<br /> -0.128 s ~  -0.064 s - Comptonization - $E_{peak} = (229 ± 78)$ keV, $\alpha$ = 0.85 $\pm$ 1.38, peak energy flux: (7.3 $\pm$ 2.5) x 10$^{-7}$<br />These are used to  place GRB 170817A in the SGRBs pulation with known redshift.

More detailed analysis included spectralfits to the twoapparently distinct components. <font color=red>The main emission episode,represented by the peak in Figure2, appears as a typical SGRB best fit by a power law</font> with an exponential cutoff with spectral index $\alpha = -0.62 \pm 0.40$ and $E_{peak}=(185 \pm 62)$ keV over a time interval $T_0^{GBM}$ - 0.320 s to $T_0^{GBM}$ + 0.256 s.The time-averaged flux is (3.1 $\pm$ 0.7) x 10$^{-7}$ erg / s cm$^2$.<font color=red>The tail emission that appears spectrally soft is best fit by a blackbody(BB)spectrum</font>,  with  temperature of $k_{B}T = (10.3 \pm 1.5) keV$  and a time-averaged flux of (0.53 $\pm$ 0.10) x 10$^{-7}$ erg / s cm$^2$,  with  selected  source interval $T_0^{GBM}$ + 0.832 s to $T_0^{GBM}$ + 1.984 s. However, this emission is too weak and near the lower energy detectionbound of GBM to completely rule out a non-thermal spectrum.
>-0.320 ~ +0.256s(main emission) - exponential cutoff PL - $\alpha = -0.62 \pm 0.40$, $E_{peak}=(185 \pm 62)$ keV, average flux: (3.1 $\pm$ 0.7) x 10$^{-7}$ <br />+0.832s ~ +1.984s - BB - $k_{B}T = (10.3 \pm 1.5) keV$,  average flux: (0.53 $\pm$ 0.10) x 10$^{-7}$

The temporal analysis yielded a $T_{90}$,defined as the time interval over which 90%  of  the  burst fluence  between50–300 keV is accumulated, of (2.0 $\pm$ 0.5)s  starting  at $T_0^{GBM}$ -0.192s . The duration extends beyond the main emission pulse due to the soft component. This analysis reports a 64 ms peak photon flux of (3.7 $\pm$ 0.9) photons/s cm$^2$ and occurs from $T_0^{GBM}$ +0.0s to $T_0^{GBM}$ +0.064s. The minimum variability timescale for GRB 170817A is (0.125 $\pm$ 0.064)s.

Using the soft spectral template of the GBM targeted search, a Band function with a low energy power law index of −1.9, a high energy index of −3.7, and an Epeak of 70 keV, Goldstein et al.(2017)also set 3σ flux upper limits on precursor impulsive gamma-ray emission. The limits on precursor activity out to -200s are(6.8–7.3) × 10e−7 erg/s cm$^2$ and (2.0–2.1) × 10e−7 erg /s cm$^2$ for signals of 0.1 s and 1.0 s duration, respectively. <font colot=red>The tail emission of GRB 170817A is not consistent with the general behavior of SGRBs with extended emission</font>(Kaneko et al.2015). We set limits on possible extended emission over 10 s intervals out to $T_0^{GBM}$ +100s is(6.4–6.6) ×10e−8 erg /s cm$^2$. Additional upper limits for representative normal and harder spectra are provided in Goldstein et al.(2017)and are up to a factor of a few less constraining.

### 2.3 INTEGRAL SPI-ACS Observation of GRB 170817A

A routine follow-up search for short transients in SPI-ACS identified a single excess at <font color=red>$T_0^{ACS} = T_0^{GW} +1.88 s$</font> with S/N = 4.6 at the 0.1 s timescale. <font color=purple>The correction to the geocentric system assumes the location of the optical transient and results in delay of the signal arrival to INTEGRAL of148.96 ms</font>. In order to compare the intensity of the eventobserved by SPI-ACS to the GBM measurement, we computethe range of fluences compatible with the SPI-ACS data in the [-0.320 s, +0.256s] time interval centered in $T_0^{GBM}$, assuming the GBM best fit spectral model in the same interval. We derive a fluence estimate of $(1.4 \pm 0.4) x 10^{-7}$ erg/cm$^2$.(statisticaluncertainty only)in the 75–2000 keV energy range, consistentwith GBM.
>$T_0^{ACS} = T_0^{GW} +1.88 s$ (+1.74 s as for GBM)<br />The fluence in the [-0.320 s, +0.256s] time interval of INTEGRAL(75–2000 keV) is consistent with that of GBM: (1.4 $\pm$ 0.4) x 10$^{-7}$ erg/cm$^2$ versus (3.1 $\pm$ 0.7) x 10$^{-7}$ erg/s$\cdot$cm$^2$).

The significance of the association between the GBM observation of GRB 170817A and the event observed by SPI-ACS is <font color=purple>4.2σ</font>. While SPI-ACS would not have alone reported this event as a GRB, it would have reported the event while searching around GW170817, with an <font color=purple>independent association significance of 3.2σ</font>. SGRBs are routinely jointly detected by GBM and SPI-ACS and the association evidence from time coincidence as well as the consistency between the event fluences and temporal properties observed by the two instruments proves that <font color=red>both GBM and SPI-ACS observed the same event.</font> The difference between the time of arrival of the signal in theSPI-ACS and GBM detectors can be exploited to improve the gamma-ray localization of GRB 170817A, which may be beneficial in future joint detections.
>1.Both GBM and SPI-ACS observed the same event, because of the time coincidence and the consistency between the fluences and temporal propeties.<br />2.The difference of the signal arrival time for each instrument can be used to improve the GRB localization.

The significant interval of the SPI-ACS lightcurve of GRB 170817A is limited to a single pulse with a duration of100 ms(third panel in Figure1). GBM and SPI-ACS see themain pulse as appearing to have different durations because they are sensitive in different energy ranges.If the GBM data are shown in an energy range higher than the standard 50-300 keV, the main pulse is consistent with the 100 ms interval seen in SPI-ACS. The lightcurve observed by SPI-ACS reveals a short rise time(50 < ms)and a rapid drop(50 < ms).We therefore <font color=red>constrain the pulse duration in the energy range observed by SPI-ACS(∼75–2000 keV) to less than 100 ms.</font>
>The different energy band of the two instruments resulted in the difference appearing duration time. The pulse duration of SPI-ACS is constrained to be less than 100ms (half a second as for the GBM triggering pulse).

## 3. Unambiguous Association

The separation of GRBs into short and long classes was suggested by their duration distributions and reinforced by differences in the prompt gamma-ray emission of the two classes. Tying the short class to a different progenitor from the long class was strengthened by redshift measurements of their hosts. <font color=blue>Association of SGRBs with older stellar populations than long GRBs was supported by the types of galaxies that host them; the connection to BNS mergers was strengthened by the offsets of SGRBs afterglows from their host galaxies and by the absence of supernovae following nearby, well-observed SGRBs.</font> We provide conclusive evidence for the BNS-SGRB connection by quantifying the chance temporal and spatial coincidence for GRB 170817A and GW170817 arising from two independent astrophysical events.
>1.The connection between SGRBs and BNS mergers have already been supported by some indirect observational evidences(the offsets of SGRBs afterglows from their host; the absence of supernovae).<br />2.We provide conclusive evidence by quantifing the likelihood for GW170817 and GRB 170817A of being two independent events under the observational coincidence.

To quantify the temporal agreement, we consider the null hypothesis that SGRB and GW detection events are independent Poisson processes and determine how unlikely it is to observe an unassociated SGRB within $\Delta t_{SGRB-GW} = 1.74 s$ of the GW signal. GWs from a BNS merger have been detected once to date, <font color=purple>so the p-value is $P_{temporal} = 2\Delta t_{SGRB-GW} R_{GBM-SGRB}$</font>,where $R_{GBM-SGRB}$ is the GBM SGRB detection rate. Further, we account for the livetime of GBM, which is disabled 15% of the time to preserve detector lifetime in regions of high particle activity during transit through the South Atlantic Anomaly. <font color=red>Therefore,$P_{temporal}$=2 x (1.74s) x (351/3324days/0.85)=5.0 $\times$ 10$^{-6}$</font>, which corresponds to  $\sigma$4.4 significance in Gaussian statistics.
>Temporal agreement for being independent events is $5.0 \times 10^{-6}$<br />p-value is the probability? why is it calculated that way? Maybe it is the probability that a SGRB detection happens after a GW detection within 1.74s, but how to explain the '2'?

In order to quantify the spatial agreement of the independent GBM and LIGO–Virgo localizations, <font color=purplr>we define the statistic $S=\sum_{i=1}^{N_{pix}} P_{1i} P_{2i}$, where P1 and P2 are the posterior probabilities from GBM and LIGO–Virgo maps and i is the HEALPix pixel index.S is then compared against a background distribution generated by randomly shifting and rotating GBM posteriors from a representative sample of 164 SGRBs localized by the targeted search. We factor in the estimated localization systematic, and randomly shift and rotate each map 10 times.</font> This background method accounts for the morphology and size distributions of GBM SGRB localizations. We find a p-value $P_{spatial} = 0.01$ that the two independent localizations agree this well by chance.
>Spatial agreement for being independent events is 0.01.

The temporal and spatial p-values are independent quantities,thus the probability that GRB 170817A and GW170817 occurred this close in time and with this level of location agreement by chance is $P_{temporal} \times P_{spatial} = (5.0 \times 10^{-6}) \times (0.01) = 5.0 \times 10^{-8}$, corresponding to a Gaussian-equivalent significance of 5.3$\sigma$. This unambiguous association <font color=red>confirms that BNS mergers are progenitors of(at least some)SGRBs.</font>
>$P_{temporal} \times P_{spatial} = (5.0 \times 10^{-6}) \times (0.01) = 5.0 \times 10^{-8}$ for being independent events comes the unambiguous association of GW170817 and GRB 170817A, confirming the BNS mergers are progenitors of(at least some)SGRBs.

## 4. Implications for Fundamental physics

<font color=blue>Little or no arrival delay between photons and GWs over cosmological distances is expected as the intrinsic emission times are similar and the propagation speeds of EM and GWs are thought to be identical.</font> In this Section we discuss the implications on fundamental physics of the temporal offset of (1.74 $\pm$ 0.05) s measured between GW170817 and GRB 170817A.

Standard EM theory minimally coupled to general relativity predicts that GWs and light propagate with identical speeds.The refractive index of vacuum is expected to be unity, and <font color=blue>both waves are expected to be affected by background gravitational potentials in the same way.</font> The arrival delay of only a few seconds across a distance greater than one hundred million light years places stringent constraints on deviations from fundamental principles. <font color=red>We use the observed temporal offset, the distance to the source, and the expected emission-time difference to place constraints on the deviation of the speed of gravity from the speed of light, and on violations of Lorentz invariance and the equivalence principle.</font>
>Using the temporal offset, the distance, and the expected eimssion-time difference to constrain the devation of the speed of gravity from $c$, the violations of Lrentz invariance and the equivalence principle.

<div id="sect4.1"></div>

### 4.1 Speed of Gravity

Assuming a small difference in travel time $\Delta t$ between photons and GWs, and the known travel distance D, the fractional speed difference during the trip can be written $\Delta v/v_{EM} \approx v_{EM} \Delta t/D$, where $\Delta v = v_{GW} - v_{EM}$. This relation is less constraining for small distances, hence we conservatively use here **$D = 26 Mpc$, the lower bound of the 90% credible interva**l on luminosity distance derived from the GW sigma.<font color=red>If we conservatively assume that the peak of the GW signal and the first photons were emitted simultaneously, attributing the entire (1.74 $\pm$ 0.05) s lag to faster travel by the GW signal, this time difference provides an upper bound on $\Delta v$.</font> <font color=red>To obtain alower bound on $\Delta v$, one can assume that the two signals were emitted at times differing by more than 1.74s with the faster EM signal making up some of the difference.</font> As a conservative bound relative to the few second delays discussed in Section2.1, **we assume the SGRB signal was emitted 10 s after the GW signal.** The resulting constraint on the fractionalspeed difference is

$$
-3 \times 10^{-15} \le \frac{\Delta v}{v_{EM}} \le +7 \times 10^{-16}
\tag{1}
$$

The intergalactic medium dispersion has negligible impact on the gamma-ray photon speed, with an expected propagation delay many orders of magnitude smaller than our errors on $v_{GW}$

>Upper limit and lower bound??? of the fractional speed difference are obtained.The intergalactic medium dispersion has negligible impact on the speed difference.

### 4.2 Lorentz Invariance  Violation Limits

Within a comprehensive effective field theory description of Lorentz  violation, <font color=blue>the relative group velocity of GWs and EM waves, is controlled by differences in coefficients for Lorentz violation in the gravitational sector and the photon sector at each mass dimension d</font>. We focus here on the non-birefringent, non-dispersive limit at mass dimension d = 4, as it yields by far the most impressive results. In this case, the difference in group velocities for the two sectors takesthe form:

>在普朗克尺度下，相对论和标准模型应该可以合并为一个统一理论，而洛伦兹违反是这一统一理论的一种体现。洛伦兹违反可用有效场理论去解释，在这个理论下，引力波和电磁波的速度差异由理论中引力部分和光子部分的参数不同导致。在质量维数d=4下，该差异表示如下(<http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0312310v2>)

$$
\delta v = - \sum_{lm,l\le2} Y_{lm}(\hat n)(\frac{1}{2}(-1)^{1+l} \overline S_{lm}^{(4)} - c_{(I)lm}^{(4)})
\tag{2}
$$

<font color=blue>The result is presented in a spherical harmonic</font>, $Y_{lm}$, basis, $\overline S_{lm}^{(4)}$ and $c_{(I)lm}^{(4)}$ being spherical-basis coefficients for Lorentz violation in the gravitational and EM sectors, respectively. The direction $\hat n$ refers to the sky position.
>可看出速度差异可由球谐函数即相关系数表示，反过来有了速度差异就可以限制这些系数，进而限制洛伦兹违反的有关理论。

For ease of comparison with the many existing sensitivities to the d = 4 gravity-sector coefficients, an analysis in which the coefficients are constrained one at a time is useful, with all other coefficients,including the EM sector ones, set to zero. These results are presented in Table 1 along with the best constraints for each coefficient prior to this work. These results can be compared with the isotropic A, $\alpha_{LV} = 2$ Lorentz violation parametrization used by Abbott et al.(2017c)indispersive GW tests. The $\alpha_{LV} = 2$ limit of this parametrization is equivalent to the isotropic limit of the framework discussed above, with $\overline S_{lm}^{(4)} \rarr \sqrt{4\pi}A$. Constraints on A for $\alpha_{LV} = 2$ can be obtained from the first line of Table 1; these cannot be established within the analysis carried out in Abbott et al.(2017c).

### 4.3 Test of the Equivalence Principle

<font color=blue>Probing whether EM radiation and GWs are affected by background gravitational potentials in the same way is a test of the equivalence principle.</font> One way to achieve this is to use the **Shapiro effect**, <font color=blue>which predicts that the propagation time of massless particles in curved spacetime,i.e., through gravitational fields, is slightly increased with respect to the flat spacetime case.</font> We will consider the following simple parametrized form of the Shapiro delay:
> 可以用Shpiro（Shapiro延迟形式如下）关系来测试引力场对经过的电磁辐射和引力波产生的影响是否是一样的。这实际上也是对等效原理的验证。

$$
\delta t_S = \frac{1+\gamma}{c^3}\int_{r_e}^{r_0} U(r(l))dl
\tag{3}
$$

where $r_e$ and $r_0$ denote emission and observation positions, respectively, $U(r)$ is the gravatational potential, and the integral is computed along the wave path. $\gamma$ parametrizes a deviation from the <font color=blue>Einstein-Maxwell theory, which minimally couples classical electromagnetism to general relativity</font>. We allow for different values of $\gamma$ for the propagation of EM and GWs ($\gamma_{EM}$ and $\gamma_{GW}$, respectively, with $\gamma_{EM}$ = $\gamma_{GW}= 1$ in the Einstein-Maxwell theory).
>式子表示一个无质粒子在相同起始点的条件下途经弯曲时空（有引力场）相比途径平直时空（无引力场）所需时间的增加量。$\gamma$在Einstein-Maxwell理论中对于EM和GW都为1，这里假设$\gamma_{EM}$和$\gamma_{GW}$不同，即可利用两者的时间差来限制$\gamma_{EM}$ - $\gamma_{GW}$的大小，从而验证GW和EM波受引力场的影响是一样的。

While obtaining the best bound on the difference betweenthe Shapiro time delays requires modeling the potential $U(r)$ along the entire line of sight, we determine a conservative bound on $\gamma_{EM}$ - $\gamma_{GW}$ by considering only the effect of the Milky Way outside a sphere of 100 kpc, and by using a Keplerian potential with a mass of 2.5 x 10$^{11} M_{sun}$. Using the same time bounds as Equation (1) we find

$$
-2.6 \times 10^{-7} \le \gamma_{GW} - \gamma_{EM} \le 1.2 \times 10^{-6}
\tag{4}
$$
>为了简化计算，只近似考虑银河系在距离中心100kpc以外的地方产生的影响，并取质量为2.5 x 10$^{11} M_{sun}$。

The best absolute bound on $\gamma_{EM}$ is $\gamma_{EM} -1 = (2.1 \pm 2.3) \times 10^{-5}$ from the measurement of the Shapiro delay (at radio wavelengths)with the Cassini spacecraft.

## 5. Astrophysical Implications

The joint GW–GRB detection provides us with unprecedented information about the central engine of SGRBs. The elay between the GW and the GRB trigger times allows us toexamine some basic GRB physics. <font color=red>This delay could be intrinsic to the central engine, reflecting the time elapsed from the moment the binary components come into contact to the formation of a remnant BH and the resulting jet.</font> This interpretation includes the case of a relatively long-lived massive NS remnant, which has been suggested to survive from seconds to minutes after merger. The delay could also be due to the propagation time of the relativistic jet, including the time it takes for the jet to break out of the dense gaseous environment produced by non-relativistic merger ejecta and/or the emitting region to become transparent to gamma-rays.
>两种解释GW和EM之间延迟的猜测：<br />1.中心引擎导致延迟，即引力波发出的时间早于喷流形成的时间。<br />2.相对论喷流突破包层物质需要时间，以及/或辐射区域变为伽玛射线薄所需的时间。

We first discuss the implications that the time delay between the GW and EM emission has on the physical properties of the emitting region when considering the jet propagation and transparency scenarios. Here we assume that the entire delay is due to the expansion of the emitting region and neglect any intrinsic delays between the moment of binary coalescence and the launching of the resulting jet, thus placing limits on the physical properties of the system. Then we consider the impactof SGRB emission from an NS merger on the EOS of dense matter.
>这里先只考虑第二种解释中的情景，即延迟仅来自于暴周介质的作用而不考虑并合过程的影响，讨论这种情况造成的时间延迟会对辐射区域的物理性质有何反映。<br />之后考虑双中子星并合产生SGRB对致密物质的状态方程有何影响。

### 5.1 GRB Physics

The main hard peak observed for GRB 170817A lasted roughly half a second. <font color=red>This peak is consistent with a single intrinsic emission episode as it is well described by a single pulse, showing no evidence for significant substructure(spikes).</font> This interpretation is consistent with the SPI-ACS observation of a single peak. The GBM detection of GRB 170817A also shows no evidence for photons with energy > 511 keV,<font color=purple>implying that the outflow does not require a high bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ to overcome photon–photon absorption at the source.</font>
>GRB 170817 的主峰可用一个单脉冲（single pulse）描述，显示内部瞬时辐射只有一个阶段而没有显著的次级结构。这与SPI-ACS的观测也相符。（哪10-50kev上观测到的软一点的次峰呢？？？）<br />GBM 没有发现511keV以上的光子，显示喷流不需要很高的体洛伦兹因子去克服源的光子-光子吸收。（???正负电子对湮灭倒是能产生511keV的伽玛光子，也就是说光子光子吸收会长生正负电子对，进而产生511keV光子？和体洛伦兹因子又有什么关系？）

Explanations for the extreme energetics and short timescalesobserved in GRBs invoke a near instantaneous release of alarge amount of energy in a compact volume of space. This is commonly referred to as thefireball model, and it is the framework that we will assume forthe remainder of this section. The fireball model is largely independent of the burst progenitor and focuses on the dynamics of such a system after this sudden release of energy. The resulting pair-plasma is optically thick and quickly expands under its own pressure to produce a highly relativistic outflow that coasts asymptotically with a constant Lorentz factor $\Gamma$. Withinthefireball, kinetic energy is imparted to particles entrained in the outflow, although alternative models exist inwhich the energy outflow occurs mostly as Poynting flux. The observed gamma-ray pulses are attributed to shocks internal to this relativistic outflow,which convert some of their kinetic energy into the observed EM radiation. These shocks could produce the predominantly non-thermal emission observed in mostGRBs, although non-shock heating models have also been proposed. The overall multi-pulse duration of a burst is thought to reflect the time that the inner engine was active (e.g., producing inhomogeneities in the outflow represented as shells traveling with different bulk velocities) and the variability of individual pulses reflects the size of the shells producing the emission. Therefore, the values inferred from the data are independent of the inclination angle from the total angular momentum axis of the system, as long as the viewer is within the opening angle of the jet.
>简单介绍GRB喷流模型。

We can examine the implications of the observed delay between the GW and EM signals in the internal shock scenario if we consider two shells emitted at time $t_{GW} = 0$ and time $t_{GW} = \Delta t_{engine}$. If the Lorentz factor of the second shell,$\gamma_{2}$,is greater than the Lorentz factor of the first shell,$\gamma_{1}$, the shells will collide at time
>假设中心源先后喷发出两个壳层，第一个壳层喷发的同时也是（强度最高的）引力波发出的时候，第二个壳层速度比地一个要快，当二者发生撞击时即释放出大量伽玛射线，由此导致GW与EM辐射的时间延迟为：

$$
t_{delay} = \frac{\Delta t_{engine}}{1-(\gamma_{1}/\gamma_{2})^2}
\tag{5}
$$

which is valid if $\gamma_{2}, \gamma_{2} >> 1$. <font color=blue>If the shells have comparable masses, conservation of energy and momentum leads to a merged shell with Lorentz factor $\gamma_m = (\gamma_1\gamma_2)^{1/2}$.</font> The resulting pulse profile is determined by two timescales. <font color=blue>The rise time (which we equate to the minimum variability timescale) can be attributed to the light-crossing time of the individual emission regions</font> and is expressed as
>两壳层相撞后融合，速度发生改变，观测自撞击产生的辐射的脉冲时长由两个时标决定：增强时标和衰减时标。增强时标可由光子穿过辐射区域的时间表示：

$$
\Delta t_{rise} \approx \frac{\delta R}{2c\gamma_m^2}
\tag{6}
$$

where $\delta R$ is the thickness of the emitting region. <font color=blue>The decay time reflects angular effects, where off-axis emission is delayed and affected by a varying Doppler boost due to the curvature of the relativistic shell.</font> <font color=purple>This timescale is essentially the difference in light-travel time between photons emitted along the line of sight and photons emitted at an angle θ along a shell of radius R.</font> This timescale may be expressed as
>衰减时标实际上反映的是观察角度的影响，可表示为：

$$
\Delta t_{decay} = \frac{R(1 - cos\Delta\theta)}{c} \approx \frac{R(\Delta\theta)^2}{2c} \approx \frac{R}{2c\gamma_m^2} > \Delta t_{rise}
\tag{7}
$$

where we assume that the solid angle accessible to the observer is limited by relativistic beaming and thus given by $\theta \sim 1/\gamma$. At the same time, the distance that the first shell has traveled since ejection is $R_1 \approx 2c\gamma_1^2 t_{delay}$, leading to
>同时，第一个壳层已经传播的距离为$R_1 \approx 2c\gamma_1^2 t_{delay}$，代入7式中的R，可得：

$$
\Delta t_{decay} \approx t_{delay}(\gamma_1 / \gamma_2) = \frac{\Delta t_{engine}}{1 - (\gamma_1 / \gamma_2)^2} \frac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}
\tag{8}
$$

The conclusion is a linear correlation between the delay in the GW and EM signals and the resulting pulse duration, modulo the ratio of the Lorentz factors of  the two colliding shells.
>结果得到衰减时标（近似为GRB的持续时标）和延迟时间之间具有线性关系，系数为两壳层的洛伦兹因子之比。<br />增强时标呢？？？相比与衰减时标可以忽略？？？

The relative similarity between the gamma-ray duration T90 and the delay between the GW and the EM emission gives $\Delta t_{decay}/t_{delay} \sim 1$, pointing to an internal shock scenario in which the difference in the Lorentz factors of the colliding shells, $\Delta \gamma$, is much smaller than their typical values, i.e. $\Delta\gamma << \gamma$. <font color=red>This would imply that the jet was launched shortly after the time of the merger and points to a relatively short $\Delta t_{engine}$ time in which the central engine was active.</font> <font color=blue>Such a scenario would produce a collision that was  relatively **inefficient** at converting the internal energy of the shocks to radiation</font>, resulting in a significant isotropic equivalent kinetic energy remaining in the merged shell. <font color=red>This would lead to a very significant energy injection into the resulting afterglow,</font> producing latetime “refreshed shocks”, which are typically not observed in the X-ray (and optical) lightcurves of SGRBs.
>由于GRB持续时间和延迟时间基本一致(???主峰不是只有半秒吗)，可得两壳层的洛伦兹因子很接近，而这表明喷流在并合之后很短的时间内就形成了，这将导致壳层碰撞过程中不会有效得将内能转化成辐射，结果大部分转化成动能并注入到余辉中。但这在短暴中并不多见。

<font color=red>Some of these energetics constraints can be alleviated if we exclude the soft thermal emission from the gamma-ray duration estimate.</font> In this case, the prompt non-thermal emission of $\Delta t_{decay} \approx 0.5s $ would be due to internal shocks and the soft thermal emission would be attributed to a separate component. In this case we obtain $\Delta t_{decay} / t_{delay} \approx 0.3$, impling $\gamma_2 \approx 3\gamma_1$. These energetics considerations may suggest that the initial hard pulse and the subsequent thermal emission observed by GBM may indeed be distinct components.
>如果把热辐射的持续时间从gamma-ray持续时间中排除（？？？前提是热辐射和非热辐射不是同时的，怎么保证？还是假设？），则有$\Delta t_{decay} \approx 0.5 s$。这样，$\gamma_2 \approx 3\gamma_1$。可能表明GBM观测到的一开始的主峰和后面的热辐射的确是来自不同的成分。（？？？热成分和非热成分来源不同不是很正常吗，另外这个结果又是怎么表明的？）

Within the context of the internal shock model, if we assume the entire (1.74 $\pm$ 0.05)s delay between the GW and the EM emission is due to jet propagation time and use a Lorentz factor of $\gamma$ < 100 for the first shell, we can estimate an upper limit  to  the  radius  of  the  relativistic  outflow  to  be $R \sim 5 \times 10^{14} cm$ or $\sim 30 au$. The minimum variability time-scale $\Delta t_{rise} = \Delta t_{min} \sim 0.125$s.(Goldstein et al.2017) yields an  upper  limit on the size of the emitting region of $\delta R \sim 4 \times 10^{13} cm$, or $\sim 3 au$. The ratio of the two is independent of the unknown  Lorentz factor and is of order $\delta R / R \sim 10\%$.
>在以上的条件下，若取延迟时间为1.74s,第一壳层的洛伦兹因子小于100, 则可得一个喷流到达半径的上限$R \sim 5 \times 10^{14}$ cm; 再另 $\Delta t_{rise} = \Delta t_{min} \sim 0.125$s，可得辐射区域厚度上限为$\delta R \sim 4 \times 10^{13}$ cm。两者之比约为10%。

The single-pulsed nature of the gamma-ray emission, as well as  the  observed $\Delta t_{decay}/t_{delay} \sim 1$,  also  leaves  open  the possibility that the GBM signal is entirely of an external shock origin. In this scenario, the relativistic outflow converts its internal energy to radiation due to its interaction with an external medium, such as the interstellar matter.  If we associate the duration of the main pulse with the deceleration time, i.e., the timescale over which the jet is significantly decelerated by interstellar matter of constan tdensity n, in the external shock scenario
>另一种情况，如果GBM观测到的是来自外激波的辐射，那么喷流在暴周介质中的减速时标为

$$
t_{dec} = [3 E_{k,iso} / (4 \pi \gamma^{8} n m_p c^5)]^{1/3} =T_{obs}
\tag{9}
$$

Ek,iso is the kinetic energy of the jet calculated assuming a gamma-ray production efficiency of 20%,$m_p = 1.67 \times 10^{-27}$ kg is the proton mass,c is the speed of light, and Tobs is the approximate duration of the main peak. We can thus estimate the Lorentz factor of the jet in the external shock scenatrio to be
>由此可进一步估算外激波情形中喷流的洛伦兹因子：

$$
\gamma \approx 310 (\frac{E_{k,iso}}{2 \times 10^{47} erg})^{1/8} (\frac{n}{0.1cm^{-3}}^{-1/8})(\frac{T_{obs}}{0.5 s})^{-3/8}
\tag{10}
$$

The deceleration radius represents the upper limit of efficient energy extraction (even for internal shocks)and can be expressed as
>另外也可得到喷流减速半径：

$$
R_{dec} = 2\gamma^2 c T_{obs}\gamma
\tag{11}
$$

Therefore, the deceleration radius and associated Lorentz factoralso serve as upper limits to the radius and Lorentz factor of theemitting region in the internal shock scenario.

The  primary  challenge  of  this interpretation is in explaining the nature of the hard non-thermal emission preceding the BB component. If both components are the result of the same expanding fireball, the photospheric emission is expected to occur earlier than or at the same time as the non-thermal emission. This requirement can be reconciled with the GBM data if the thermal component was subdominant and indistinguishable during the initial hard non-thermal pulse.

>可能的解释就是光学薄在主峰就已经发生了，只不过那个时候的黑体成分相比非热成分可以忽略。

除此之外文章还提到了一些机制，如黑体辐射来自于cacoon，或者延迟是因为相对论性喷流突破'sub-relativistic dense ejecta'需要时间导致的，但这个情景下，如果采用典型的抛射物质量，则得到的突破时间爱要短于实际观测到的延迟。而如果降低喷流动能，有可能导致喷流突破失败。

## 7. Conclusion

The joint observation of GW170817 and GRB 170817A conﬁrms the association of SGRBs with BNS mergers. <font color=red>With just one joint event, we have set stringent limits on fundamental physics and probed the central engine of SGRBs in ways that have not been possible with EM data alone</font>, demonstrating the importance of multi-messenger astronomy.
>The joint event set a stringent limits on fundamental physics and probed the central engine of SGRBs in ways that have not been possible with EM data alone.

<font color=red>The small time offset and independent localizations, though coarse, allowed an unambiguous association of these two events.</font> Because GRB 170817A occurred nearby, an autonomous trigger on-board GBM alerted follow-up observers to the presence of a counterpart to GW170817. At design sensitivity, however, Advanced LIGO and Virgo could in principle detect GW170817 beyond the distance that any active gamma-ray observatory would trigger on a burst like GRB 170817A. Subthreshold searches for SGRBs can extend the gamma-ray horizon and the detection of GRB 170817A provides motivation for further subthreshold search development.
>subthreshold search???

A joint detection at greater distance and for an SGRB with more typical energetics would allow tighter constraints on the temporal offset and the derived inferences. Should NS–BH binaries also be SGRB progenitors, only a joint detection between GW and EM can provide decisive evidence.
>More precious and typical joint detection is needed for a tighter constraints and for the verification of the NS–BH binariy origin of SGRBs.

In this Letter <font color=red>we propose several explanations for the observed dimness of GRB 170817A</font>. <font color=red>We suggest joint detections should be more common than previously predicted</font>, and future observations of multiple events should enable a study of the populations of mergers and their associated SGRBs, shedding light on the jet geometry and intrinsic brightness distribution. Furthermore, detections with multiple GW interferometers can provide more stringent constraints on the inclination angles of these systems. The joint detections of SGRBs arising from BNS and NS–BH mergers will constrain the fraction of SGRBs originating from each progenitor class.
