In the Second part of The Konus-Wind Catalog of Gamma-Ray Bursts with Known Redshifts (first part: Tsvetkova et al. 2017; T17), we present the results of a systematic study of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with reliable redshift estimates detected simultaneously by the Konus-Wind (KW) experiment (in the waiting mode) and by the Swift/BAT (BAT) telescope during the period from 2005 January to the end of 2018. By taking advantage of the high sensitivity of BAT and the wide spectral band of KW we were able to constrain the peak spectral energies, the broadband energy fluences, and the peak fluxes for the joint KW-BAT sample of 167 weak, relatively soft GRBs (including four short bursts). Based on the GRB redshifts, which span the range 0.04≤z≤9.4, we estimate the rest-frame, isotropic-equivalent energy, and peak luminosity. For 14 GRBs with reasonably constrained jet breaks, we provide the collimation-corrected values of the energetics. This work extends the sample of KW GRBs with known redshifts to 338 GRBs, the largest set of cosmological GRBs studied to date over a broad energy band. With the full KW sample, accounting for the instrumental bias, we explore GRB rest-frame properties, including hardness-intensity correlations, GRB luminosity evolution, luminosity and isotropic-energy functions, and the evolution of the GRB formation rate, which we find to be in general agreement with those reported in T17 and other previous studies.

  - 将这样的样本扩充至338个
- 限制167个较弱且相对较软GRB（包括4个短暴）的peak spectral energies，broadband fluences(10 keV–10 MeV), 以及peak fluxes。
- 利用红移(跨度0.04≤z≤9.4)计算静系各项同性能量和峰值光度
- 对于14个有采样充分的jet break的GRB，研究了准直修正的能量
- 利用KW全样本(316个长暴)，研究了GRB静系下性质，包括hardness-intensity correlations, GRB luminosity evolution, luminosity and isotropic-energy functions, and the evolution of the GRB formation rate，这些与first part以及以往的研究相符

A bright gamma-ray flare interpreted as a giant magnetar flare in NGC 253

Magnetars are young, highly magnetized neutron stars that produce extremely rare giant flares of gamma-rays, the most luminous astrophysical phenomena in our Galaxy. The detection of these flares from outside the Local Group of galaxies has been predicted, with just two candidates so far. Here we report on the extremely bright gamma-ray flare GRB 200415A of April 15, 2020, which we localize, using the Interplanetary Network, to a tiny (20 sq. arcmin) area on the celestial sphere, that overlaps the central region of the Sculptor galaxy at 3.5 Mpc from the Milky Way. From the Konus-Wind detections, we find a striking similarity between GRB 200415A and GRB 051103, the even more energetic flare that presumably originated from the M81/M82 group of galaxies at nearly the same distance (3.6 Mpc). Both bursts display a sharp, millisecond-scale, hard-spectrum initial pulse, followed by an approximately 0.2 s long steadily fading and softening tail. Apart from the huge initial pulses of magnetar giant flares, no astrophysical signal with this combination of temporal and spectral properties and implied energy has been reported previously. At the inferred distances, the energy released in both flares is on par with that of the December 27, 2004 superflare from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1806-20, but with a higher peak luminosity. Taken all together, this makes GRB 200415A and its twin GRB 051103 the most significant candidates for extragalactic magnetar giant flares, both a factor of five more luminous than the brightest Galactic magnetar flare observed previously, thus providing an important step towards a better understanding of this fascinating phenomenon.

Identification of a Local Sample of Gamma-Ray Bursts Consistent with a Magnetar Giant Flare Origin

Cosmological Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are known to arise from distinct progenitor channels: short GRBs mostly from neutron star mergers and long GRBs from a rare type of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) called collapsars. Highly magnetized neutron stars called magnetars also generate energetic, short-duration gamma-ray transients called Magnetar Giant Flares (MGFs). Three have been observed from the Milky Way and its satellite galaxies and they have long been suspected to contribute a third class of extragalactic GRBs. We report the unambiguous identification of a distinct population of 4 local (<5 Mpc) short GRBs, adding GRB 070222 to previously discussed events. While identified solely based on alignment to nearby star-forming galaxies, their rise time and isotropic energy release are independently inconsistent with the larger short GRB population at >99.9% confidence. These properties, the host galaxies, and non-detection in gravitational waves all point to an extragalactic MGF origin. Despite the small sample, the inferred volumetric rates for events above 4×1044 erg of RMGF=3.8+4.0−3.1×105 Gpc−3 yr−1 place MGFs as the dominant gamma-ray transient detected from extragalactic sources. As previously suggested, these rates imply that some magnetars produce multiple MGFs, providing a source of repeating GRBs. The rates and host galaxies favor common CCSN as key progenitors of magnetars. 

The Physics of Fast Radio Bursts

 In 2007, a very bright radio pulse was identified in the archival data of the Parkes Telescope in Australia, marking the beginning of a new research branch in astrophysics. In 2013, this kind of millisecond bursts with extremely high brightness temperature takes a unified name, fast radio burst (FRB). Over the first few years, FRBs seemed very mysterious because the sample of known events was limited. With the improvement of instruments over the last five years, hundreds of new FRBs have been discovered. The field is now undergoing a revolution and understanding of FRB has rapidly increased as new observational data increasingly accumulates. In this review, we will summarize the basic physics of FRBs and discuss the current research progress in this area. We have tried to cover a wide range of FRB topics, including the observational property, propagation effect, population study, radiation mechanism, source model, and application in cosmology. A framework based on the latest observational facts is now under construction. In the near future, this exciting field is expected to make significant breakthroughs. 


The Physics of Accretion Discs, Winds And Jets in Tidal Disruption Events

Accretion onto black holes is an efficient mechanism in converting the gas mass-energy into energetic outputs as radiation, wind and jet. Tidal disruption events, in which stars are tidally torn apart and then accreted onto supermassive black holes, offer unique opportunities of studying the accretion physics as well as the wind and jet launching physics across different accretion regimes. In this review, we systematically describe and discuss the models that have been developed to study the accretion flows and jets in tidal disruption events. A good knowledge of these physics is not only needed for understanding the emissions of the observed events, but also crucial for probing the general relativistic space-time around black holes and the demographics of supermassive black holes via tidal disruption events.
