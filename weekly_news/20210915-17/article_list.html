                                We investigate the thermal emission and extinction from dust associated with the nearby superluminous supernova (SLSN) 2018bsz. Our dataset has daily cadence and simultaneous optical and near-infrared coverage up to ~ 100 days, together with late time (+ 1.7 yr) MIR observations. At 230 days after light curve peak the SN is not detected in the optical, but shows a surprisingly strong near-infrared excess, with r - J > 3 mag and r - Ks > 5 mag. The time evolution of the infrared light curve enables us to investigate if the mid-infrared emission is from newly formed dust inside the SN ejecta, from a pre-existing circumstellar envelope, or interstellar material heated by the radiation from the SN. We find the latter two scenarios can be ruled out, and a scenario where new dust is forming in the SN ejecta at epochs > 200 days can self-consistently reproduce the evolution of the SN flux. We can fit the spectral energy distribution well at +230 d with 5 x 10^-4 solar mass of carbon dust, increasing over the following several hundred days to 10^-2 solar mass by +535 d. SN 2018bsz is the first SLSN showing evidence for dust formation within the SN ejecta, and appears to form ten times more dust than normal core-collapse SNe at similar epochs. Together with their preference for low mass, low metallicity host galaxies, we suggest that SLSNe may be a significant contributor to dust formation in the early Universe.

                                GRB 060505 was the first well-known nearby (at redshift 0.089) \"hybrid\" gamma-ray burst that has a duration longer than 2 seconds but without the association of a supernova down to very stringent limits. The prompt $\gamma-$ray flash lasting $\sim 4$ sec could consist of an intrinsic short burst and its tail emission, but the sizable temporal lag ($\sim 0.35$ sec) as well as the environment properties led to the widely-accepted classification of a long duration gamma-ray burst originated from the collapse of a massive star. Here for the $ first$ time we report the convincing evidence for a thermal-like optical radiation component in the spectral energy distribution of the early afterglow emission. In comparison to AT2017gfo, the thermal radiation is $\sim 2$ times brighter and the temperature is comparable at similar epochs. The optical decline is much quicker than that in X-rays, which is also at odds with the fireball afterglow model but quite natural for the presence of a blue kilonova. Our finding reveals a neutron star merger origin of the hybrid GRB 060505 and strongly supports the theoretical speculation that some binary neutron stars can merge ultra-quickly (within $\sim 1$ Myr) after their formation when the surrounding region is still highly star-forming and the metallicity remains low. Gravitational wave and electromagnetic jointed observations are expected to confirm such scenarios in the near future.

                                We extend previous work on gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows involving hot thermal electrons at the base of a shock-accelerated tail. Using a physically-motivated electron distribution based on first-principles simulations, we compute broadband emission from radio to TeV gamma-rays. For the first time, we present the effects of a thermal distribution of electrons on synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission. The presence of thermal electrons causes temporal and spectral structure across the entire observable afterglow, which is substantively different from models that assume a pure power-law distribution for the electrons. We show that early-time TeV emission is enhanced by more than an order of magnitude for our fiducial parameters, with a time-varying spectral index that does not occur for a pure power law of electrons. We further show that the X-ray \"closure relations\" take a very different, also time-dependent, form when thermal electrons are present; the shape traced out by the X-ray afterglows is a qualitative match to observations of the traditional decay phase.

                                The prompt emission of most gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) typically exhibits a non-thermal Band component. The synchrotron radiation in the popular internal shock model is generally put forward to explain such a non-thermal component. However, the low-energy photon index $\alpha \sim -1.5$ predicted by the synchrotron radiation is inconsistent with the observed value $\alpha \sim -1$. Here, we investigate the evolution of a magnetic field during propagation of internal shocks within an ultrarelativistic outflow, and revisit the fast cooling of shock-accelerated electrons via synchrotron radiation for this evolutional magnetic field. We find that the magnetic field is first nearly constant and then decays as $B'\propto t^{-1}$, which leads to a reasonable range of the low-energy photon index, $-3/2 < \alpha < -2/3$. In addition, if a rising electron injection rate during a GRB is introduced, we find that $\alpha$ reaches $-2/3$ more easily. We thus fit the prompt emission spectra of GRB 080916c and GRB~080825c.

                                The redshift distribution of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is not well constrained. The association of the Galactic FRB 200428 with the young magnetar SGR 1935+2154 raises the working hypothesis that FRB sources track the star formation history of the universe. The discovery of FRB 20200120E in association with a globular cluster in the nearby galaxy M81, on the other hand, casts doubts on such an assumption. We apply the Monte Carlo method developed in a previous work to test different FRB redshift distribution models against the recently released first CHIME FRB catalog in terms of their distributions in specific fluence, inferred isotropic energy, and external dispersion measure ($\rm DM_E$). Our results clearly show that the hypothesis that all FRBs track the star formation history of the universe is ruled out. The hypothesis that all FRBs track the accumulated stars throughout history describes the data better but still cannot pass both the energy and $\rm DM_E$ criteria. The data seem to be better modeled with either a redshift distribution model invoking a significant delay with respect to star formation or a hybrid model invoking both a dominant delayed population and an insignificant star formation population. We discuss the implications of this finding for FRB source models.

                                We present observations of the extremely luminous but ambiguous nuclear transient (ANT) ASASSN-17jz, spanning roughly 1200 days of the object's evolution. ASASSN-17jz was discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) in the galaxy SDSS J171955.84+414049.4 on UT 2017 July 27. The transient peaked at an absolute $B$-band magnitude of $M_{B,{\rm peak}}=-22.81$, corresponding to a bolometric luminosity of $L_{\rm bol,peak}=8.3\times10^{44}$ ergs s$^{-1}$, and exhibited late-time ultraviolet emission with a total emitted energy of $E_{\rm tot}=(1.36\pm0.08)\times10^{52}$ ergs. This late-time light is accompanied by increasing X-ray emission that becomes softer as it brightens. ASASSN-17jz exhibited a large number of spectral emission lines most commonly seen in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with little evidence of evolution, except for the Balmer lines, which became fainter and broader over time. We consider various physical scenarios for the origin of the transient, including those involving supernovae (SNe), tidal disruption event (TDEs), AGN outbursts, and ANTs. We find that the most likely explanation is that ASASSN-17jz was an SN IIn occurring in or near the disk of an existing AGN, and that the late-time emission is caused by the AGN transitioning to a more active state.

                                We characterize the local (2-kpc sized) environments of Type Ia, II, and Ib/c supernovae (SNe) that have recently occurred in nearby ($d\lesssim50$ Mpc) galaxies. Using ultraviolet (UV, from GALEX) and infrared (IR, from WISE) maps of 359 galaxies and a sample of 472 SNe, we measure the star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) and stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma_\star$) in a 2-kpc beam centered on each SN site. We show that core-collapse SNe are preferentially located along the resolved galactic star-forming main sequence, whereas Type Ia SNe are extended to lower values of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ at fixed $\Sigma_\star$, indicative of locations inside quiescent galaxies or quiescent regions of galaxies. We also test how well the radial distribution of each SN type matches the radial distributions of UV and IR light in each host galaxy. We find that, to first order, the distributions of all types of SNe mirror that of both near-IR light (3.4 and 4.5 microns, tracing the stellar mass distribution) and mid-IR light (12 and 22 microns, tracing emission from hot, small grains), and also resemble our best-estimate $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$. All types of SNe appear more radially concentrated than the UV emission of their host galaxies. In more detail, the distributions of Type II SNe show small statistical differences from that of near-IR light. We attribute this overall structural uniformity to the fact that within any individual galaxy, $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ and $\Sigma_\star$ track one another well, with variations in $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}/\Sigma_\star$ most visible when comparing between galaxies.

                                This work characterises the sky localization and early warning performance of networks of third generation gravitational wave detectors, consisting of different combinations of detectors with either the Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer configuration in sites in North America, Europe and Australia. Using a Fisher matrix method which includes the effect of earth rotation, we estimate the sky localization uncertainty for $1.4\text{M}\odot$-$1.4\text{M}\odot$ binary neutron star mergers at distances $40\text{Mpc}$, $200\text{Mpc}$, $400\text{Mpc}$, $800\text{Mpc}$, $1600\text{Mpc}$, and an assumed astrophysical population up to redshift of 2 to characterize its performance for binary neutron star observations. We find that, for binary neutron star mergers at $200\text{Mpc}$ and a network consisting of the Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer and an extra Einstein Telescope-like detector in Australia(2ET1CE), the upper limit of the size of the 90% credible region for the best localized 90% signals is $0.51\text{deg}^2$. For the simulated astrophysical distribution, this upper limit is $183.58\text{deg}^2$. If the Einstein Telescope-like detector in Australia is replaced with a Cosmic Explorer-like detector(1ET2CE), for $200\text{Mpc}$ case, the upper limit is $0.36\text{deg}^2$, while for astrophysical distribution, it is $113.55\text{deg}^2$. We note that the 1ET2CE network can detect 7.2% more of the simulated astrophysical population than the 2ET1CE network. In terms of early warning performance, we find that a network of 2ET1CE and 1ET2CE networks can both provide early warnings of the order of 1 hour prior to merger with sky localization uncertainties of 30 square degrees or less. Our study concludes that the 1ET2CE network is a good compromise between binary neutron stars detection rate, sky localization and early warning capabilities.

                                We present optical imaging and spectroscopy of SN\,2018lfe, which we classify as a Type I superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) at a redshift of $z = 0.3501$ with a peak absolute magnitude of $M_r\approx -22.1$ mag, one of the brightest SLSNe discovered. SN\,2018lfe was identified for follow-up using our FLEET machine learning pipeline. Both the light curve and the spectra of SN\,2018lfe are consistent with the broad population of SLSNe. We fit the light curve with a magnetar central engine model and find an ejecta mass of $M_{\rm ej}\approx 3.8$ M$_\odot$, a magnetar spin period of $P\approx 2.9$ ms and a magnetic field strength of $B_{\perp}\approx 2.8\times 10^{14}$ G. The magnetic field strength is near the top of the distribution for SLSNe, while the spin period and ejecta mass are near the median values of the distribution for SLSNe. From late-time imaging and spectroscopy we find that the host galaxy of SN\,2018lfe has an absolute magnitude of $M_r\approx -17.85$, ($L_B \approx 0.029$ $L^*$), and an inferred metallicity of $Z\approx 0.3$ Z$_\odot$, and star formation rate of $\approx 0.8$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$.

                                Gamma-ray Bursts (GRB) were discovered by satellite-based detectors as powerful sources of transient $\gamma$-ray emission. The Fermi satellite detected an increasing number of these events with its dedicated Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM), some of which were associated with high energy photons $(E > 10\, \mathrm{GeV})$, by the Large Area Telescope (LAT). More recently, follow-up observations by Cherenkov telescopes detected very high energy emission $(E > 100\, \mathrm{GeV})$ from GRBs, opening up a new observational window with implications on the interpretation of their central engines and on the propagation of very energetic photons across the Universe. Here, we use the data published in the 2nd Fermi-LAT Gamma Ray Burst Catalogue to characterise the duration, luminosity, redshift and light curve of the high energy GRB emission. We extrapolate these properties to the very high energy domain, comparing the results with available observations and with the potential of future instruments. We use observed and simulated GRB populations to estimate the chances of detection with wide-field ground-based $\gamma$-ray instruments. Our analysis aims to evaluate the opportunities of the Southern Wide-field-of-view Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO), to be installed in the Southern Hemisphere, to complement CTA. We show that a low-energy observing threshold $(E_{low} < 200\, \mathrm{GeV})$, with good point source sensitivity $(F_{lim} \approx 10^{-11}\, \mathrm{erg\, cm^{-2}\, s^{-1}}$ in $1\, \mathrm{yr})$, are optimal requirements to work as a GRB trigger facility and to probe the burst spectral properties down to time scales as short as $10\, \mathrm{s}$, accessing a time domain that will not be available to IACT instruments.

                                We present the complete set of {\it Hubble Space Telescope} imaging of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 and its optical counterpart AT 2017gfo. Including deep template imaging in F814W, F110W, F140W, and F160W at 3.4 years post-merger, we re-analyze the full light curve of AT 2017gfo across 12 bands from 5--1273 rest-frame days after merger. We obtain four new detections of the short $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) 170817A afterglow from 109--170 rest-frame days post-merger. These detections are consistent with the previously observed $\beta=-0.6$ spectral index in the afterglow light curve with no evidence for spectral evolution. We also analyze our limits in the case of novel late-time optical and IR emission signatures, such as a kilonova afterglow or infrared dust echo, but find our limits are not constraining in these contexts. We use the new data to construct deep optical and infrared stacks, reaching limits of $M=-6.3$ to $-4.6$ mag, to analyze the local environment around AT 2017gfo and low surface brightness features in its host galaxy NGC 4993. We rule out the presence of any globular cluster at the position of AT 2017gfo to $2.3 \times 10^{4} L_{\odot}$, including those with the reddest $V-H$ colors. Finally, we analyze the substructure of NGC 4993 in deep residual imaging, and find shell features which extend up to 71.8\arcsec\ (14.2 kpc) from the center of the galaxy. We find that the shells have a cumulative stellar mass of $6.3\times10^{8} M_{\odot}$, roughly 2% the total stellar mass of NGC 4993, and mass-weighted ages of $>$3 Gyr. We conclude that it was unlikely the GW170817 progenitor system formed in the galaxy merger, which based on dynamical signatures and the stellar population in the shells mostly likely occurred 220--685 Myr ago.

                                We consider a sample of $82$ non-repeating FRBs detected at Parkes, ASKAP, CHIME and UTMOST each of which operates over a different frequency range and has a different detection criteria. Using simulations, we perform a maximum likelihood analysis to determine the FRB population model which best fits this data. Our analysis shows that models where the pulse scatter broadening increases moderately with redshift ($z$) are preferred over those where this increases very sharply or where scattering is absent. Further, models where the comoving event rate density is constant over $z$ are preferred over those where it follows the cosmological star formation rate. Two models for the host dispersion measure ($DM_{\rm host}$) distribution (a fixed and a random $DM_{\rm host}$) are found to predict comparable results. We obtain the best fit parameter values $\alpha=-1.53^{+0.29}_{-0.19}$, $\overline{E}_{33}=1.55^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$ and $\gamma=0.77\pm 0.24$. Here $\alpha$ is the spectral index, $\gamma$ is the exponent of the Schechter luminosity function and $\overline{E}_{33}$ is the mean FRB energy in units of $10^{33} \, {\rm J}$ across $2128 - 2848\; {\rm MHz}$ in the FRB rest frame.

                                We construct the Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) luminosity function (LF) using the ZTF Bright Transient Survey (BTS) catalogue. While this magnitude-limited survey has an unprecedented number of objects, it suffers from large distance uncertainties and lacks an estimation of host extinction. We bypass these issues by calculating the intrinsic luminosities from the shape parameters of the light curve's $ g $ and $ r $ bands, with the luminosities calibrated from the well observed SNe Ia sample of the Carnegie Supernova Project, allowing us to construct, for the first time, the intrinsic LF of SNe Ia. We then use a novel tight relation between the color stretch and the synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass, $M_\mathrm{Ni56}$, to determine the $M_\mathrm{Ni56}$ distribution of SNe Ia. We find that the LFs are unimodal, with their peaks in line with previous results, but have a much lower rate of dim events and luminous events. We show that the features on top of the unimodal LF-derived distributions are all consistent with statistical noise, suggesting a single progenitor channel for the explosions. We further derive, for the first time, the SNe Ia distribution of host galaxy extinction, and find a mean selective extinction of $E(B-V)\approx0.1$ and a non-negligible fraction with large, $ >1\,\text{mag} $, extinction in the optical bands. The high extinction is typical for luminous SNe, supporting their young population origin.
